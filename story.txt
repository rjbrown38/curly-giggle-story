A brown haired, curly haired girl awoke after hearing a crack of lightning.
She then ran to her farther out of fear. He tried to calm her down by telling 
a joke that might make her giggle.

"Of all the inventions from the past 100 years" the father said, "dry erase boards seem
to be the most remarkable."  The joke flew right over her head, she still seemed
upset as ever.  So he tried again, "you know honey, the last thing my grandfather ever
told me was that it is worth spending money on good speakers.  That was some sound advice."
Still no reaction.
