Curly Giggly Story
Ryan Brown and Contributors - 2019-10-11

A brown haired, curly haired girl awoke after hearing a crack of lightning.
She then ran to her father out of fear. He tried to calm her down by telling 
a joke that might make her giggle.


"Of all the inventions from the past 100 years" the father said, "dry erase boards seem
to be the most remarkable."  The joke flew right over her head, she still seemed
upset as ever.  So he tried again, "you know honey, the last thing my grandfather ever
told me was that it is worth spending money on good speakers.  That was some sound advice."
Still no reaction.  he decided he would try again with something more basic.


"Knock knock" the father asked.
"Who's there?" the curly haired girl asked.
"Cow says." the father said.
"Cow says who?" replied the little girl.
"No!Cow says moo!" the father laughed.
But the little girl did not giggle.

The lightning struck again, this time ferociously close to the house. A lightbulb above them surged on with electricity, before exploding with an electrical hiss. The intense surge coursed through to the plugged-in computers, frying their power supplies with a loud crack and hiss. With all that noise inside, the girl shriked, immeaditely jumping on her parent's bed, sliding in under the giant pillow.
