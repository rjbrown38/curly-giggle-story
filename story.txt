A brown haired, curly haired girl awoke after hearing a crack of lightning.
She then ran to her farther out of fear. He tried to calm her down by telling 
a joke that might make her giggle.
"Knock knock" the father asked.
"Who's there?" the curly haired girl asked.
"Cow says." the father said.
"Cow says who?" replied the little girl.
"No!Cow says moo!" the father laughed.
But the little girl did not giggle.
